## Introduction

This repository is a git repository containing git templates of scientific projects. The aim is to inspire you to conduct research in an open, reproducible and honest way.

In the introduction, you could briefly present your project and refer to your papers, if any.

## Usage

To use this repository for your own research, simply click on “Use this template” at the top of this page. Change the name to something descriptive for your project and adapt the license as you wish.

You can also clone the repository and restructure it if necessary. 

In the usage section of your README, note how to retrieve your project and how to set it up.

Here's an example :

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version ≥ 4.4.2)
- Required R packages (see `requirements.txt` or `install_packages.R`)

### Steps to Use

i. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esthercrs/template_R.git
cd R-git-template
```

ii. Remove the .git directory

```bash
rm .git
```

iii. Push on your existing Git repository 

```bash
git remote add origin [your_git_url]
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

> ⚠️ This template applies to all types of code, whether you're working with Python, R or Bash, the structure remains the same. ⚠️

## Layout

The structure of your project will depend greatly on your situation. It may be a good idea to divide your project into directories and sub-directories, so that each file can be easily located.  You could possibly present a README.md for each directory, summarizing the objectives of the directory and providing examples if necessary. 

You could also describe each directory directly in the main README.md :

- `data/` : Raw and processed data files
- `scripts/` : R or Python scripts for data processing
- `results/` : Generated outputs like plots, tables, or statistics
- `docs/` : Documentation for the project
- `tests/` : Test scripts to ensure code integrity

This structure may not correspond perfectly to your intended use, so it's up to you to find what suits you best. 

### Required Files

There are a few files I consider mandatory.

- LICENSE: Legal protection for your work. It's important to think carefully about the license of your work, and it's not a decision to be taken lightly. Check out the site designed by github to help you make the right choice: https://docs.github.com/fr/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository 

- README.md: A brief description of your research project and information about the structure.
